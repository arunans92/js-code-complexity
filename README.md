# Modularity 

## Divide into files

### Summary:
The 25-pair color code, is used to identify wires in telecommunications cables.
Different codes are used for wire leads on devices such as transformers or in building wiring.
For more details refer to [This Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25-pair_color_code). 

There are 25 possible pairs of colors. 

- Each pair of colors maps to a corresponding number
- Such numbers translate to a pair of colors -
a major color and a minor color

## Exercise Details:

### Modularity

The entire translation program is in a single file.
Before adding features and making it bigger,
split the file.
This exercise has a limit on the loc (lines of code)
per file. See the workflow for details.

### New Feature Request

The color coding needs to be printed as a reference manual for wiring personnel.
This manual is a mapping from the color-names to the corresponding numbers.
Add a function that would format the color coding in a form that someone can print.
Also resolve any coding guideline violations.

# Complexity:

## Possible purpose

- Protect batteries while charging:
  at home, in public place, within vehicle / regenerative braking
- Estimate life, inventory and supply chains

## The Starting Point

We will explore the charging phase of Li-ion batteries to start with.

## Issues

- The code here has high complexity in a single function.
- The tests are not complete - they do not cover all the needs of a consumer

## Tasks

1. Reduce the cyclomatic complexity.
1. Separate pure functions from I/O
1. Avoid duplication - functions that do nearly the same thing
1. Complete the tests - cover all conditions.
1. To take effective action, we need to know
   the abnormal measure and the breach -
   whether high or low. Add this capability.

## The Exploration

How well does our code hold-out in the rapidly evolving EV space?
Can we add new functionality without disturbing the old?

## The Landscape

- Limits may change based on new research
- Technology changes due to obsolescence
- Sensors may be from different vendors with different accuracy
- Predicting the future requires Astrology!

## Keep it Simple

Shorten the Semantic distance

- Procedural to express sequence
- Functional to express relation between input and output
- Object oriented to encapsulate state with actions
- Apect oriented to capture repeating aspects
